# Resume Generator from LinkedIn PDF

This is a web application that extracts text from a LinkedIn PDF resume and converts it into a clean, modern HTML format using OpenAI's API. The application uses Flask for the backend and PyMuPDF (Fitz) for PDF text extraction.

## Features

- Upload a LinkedIn PDF resume and extract text from it.
- Use OpenAI's GPT API to generate a well-formatted HTML resume.
- Download the generated HTML resume with modern and responsive styling.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Python web framework for creating the web application.
- **PyMuPDF (Fitz)**: For extracting text from PDF files.
- **OpenAI API**: For generating HTML from the extracted resume text.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend for the web application.
